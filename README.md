# Missed Connections
## What's game about
the game consists of selecting four related items to find predefined groups, if you get all 4 groups you win. You'll get 16 items, with those items you should try to find things in common to make this groups.

## Example
Let's suppose I have 16 animals, I choose cow, pig, chicken, horse, because I think they are Farm Animals.

If i guessed right, i would get an indication of it with, in this case the tag 'FARM ANIMALS' but i could be wrong too. (these animals are in deed farm animals but in this game they could be part of another group).
